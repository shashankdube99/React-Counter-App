# React-Counter-App
Exploring Components, State, Hooks, Props

## 📚 What I Learned

Through building this simple counter app, I strengthened my understanding of:

- ✅ React functional components and JSX structure
- ✅ `useState` Hook for managing component state
- ✅ Props and passing functions between parent and child components
- ✅ Component reusability with custom props (e.g., `<CounterButton by={1} />`)
- ✅ Event handling in React (e.g., `onClick`)
- ✅ Basic CSS styling and applying class-based styles
- ✅ Clean folder structure and modular component design

  
A simple React application that demonstrates a counter with increment, decrement, and reset functionality using React hooks and components.
